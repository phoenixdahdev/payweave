/**
 * Replica-set vs standalone transaction handling (docs/v1/database.md §4/§5,
 * PW-709). Standalone MongoDB servers do not support multi-document
 * transactions ("Transaction numbers are only allowed on a replica set
 * member or mongos") — rather than pre-probing topology with an extra
 * `hello`/`isMaster` round trip (fragile across deployment shapes: replica
 * set, sharded cluster, Atlas serverless, …), {@link runTransaction} ATTEMPTS
 * a real transaction and falls back to the documented non-atomic path ONLY on
 * the specific error MongoDB raises when transactions are unsupported —
 * letting the server itself be the authority instead of guessing.
 *
 * This is safe because the very FIRST operation issued inside a session's
 * transaction on a standalone server fails immediately with that error,
 * before anything is written (transactions never partially start on
 * standalone) — so re-running the callback a second time, fully, without a
 * session, is equivalent to never having attempted a transaction at all. No
 * double-write risk from the failed attempt.
 *
 * database.md §4/§2: this fallback is safe for Payweave's purposes because
 * the two contract paths with a hard atomicity requirement —
 * `balances.consume` and `webhookEvents.claim` — are EACH already atomic
 * per-document via a single pipeline `findOneAndUpdate` regardless of
 * topology (`./period-pipeline.ts`, `./adapter.ts`); `transaction()` only
 * adds cross-document rollback on top of that, which the stale-claim timeout
 * substitutes for on standalone (never a permanently-unclaimable event,
 * database.md §2's "never a state where an unapplied event is permanently
 * unclaimable" design rule).
 *
 * CAVEAT inherited from MongoDB's own `withTransaction` helper (not specific
 * to this adapter): the driver may invoke the callback MULTIPLE TIMES on
 * transient transaction errors (`TransientTransactionError`/
 * `UnknownTransactionCommitResult` labels) — MongoDB's own documented
 * requirement is that the callback's operations be safe to repeat. Every
 * `DatabaseAdapter` store this adapter exposes is either a single atomic
 * pipeline operation (safe to repeat) or itself idempotent by construction
 * (`plans.pushVersion`'s content-hash no-op, `balances.resetTo`'s replace),
 * so this holds without extra bookkeeping.
